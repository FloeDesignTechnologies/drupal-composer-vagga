# Composer template for Drupal projects

This project template should provide a kickstart for managing your site
dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and using [Vagga](http://vagga.readthedocs.org)
to manage your development environments.

If you want to know how to use Composer as to manage tour site, have a
look at [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) 
on github.
